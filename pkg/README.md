# Standalone packages

The `pkg` directory (the current directory) contains a set of standalone packages that can be imported and used by external applications. The packages are specifically meant for the development of SuperMQ based back-end applications and implement common tasks needed by the programmatic operation of the SuperMQ platform.

## Using the packages

Fetch any package directly from the module:

```bash
go get github.com/absmach/supermq/pkg/authn
```

Then import it in your code:

```go
import "github.com/absmach/supermq/pkg/authn"
```
